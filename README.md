I will upload intresting sceme things here

    Instalation
To run these programs you will have to have drRacket, availible at https://download.racket-lang.org/.
Once you have drRacket, you will have to get simply sceme

To do this open drRacket, select "Package Manager" under the file menu. Then go to the "availible from catalog" tab. Search "simply-scheme"(without the quotes). Find the package called simply-scheme and install it. Once it is installed, quit drRacket without saving. Then open drRacket and select "Choose Language..." under the Language menu. Then select teaching languages, simply-scheme should be at the botom. Click on simply-scheme and it should be highlighted, then click the "OK" button. To test if properly installed type se in the interactions window. It should print something like <procedure:se>.

To run each program on your computer, simply download it and open it with drRacket. Then do cmd+e to show the interactions window and press the run button. Then type "(info)" into the interactions window for info about the particular program. Note that sceme uses reverse polish notation, so to calculate 2 + 3 in sceme you have to use (+ 2 3) and for 2 * 3 * 4 you use (* 2 3 4).
